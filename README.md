This is a personal fork of the excellent Infinity Themes for Plasma Desktop.  Due to the nature of the theming engine, it is difficult to customize these themes, and customizations I make to local files are often simply overwritten by the next update.  Rather than avoid updating, I realized I should make my own version, so I could compare and adopt changes from new releases as I saw fit.
